Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research:
The user research suggests that many travelers are exploring without a fixed destination, seeking inspiration and ideas. Quantitative survey data supports this, with nearly 75% of users being undecided about their next vacation spot. In qualitative interviews, users expressed frustration with overwhelming maps, unfamiliar destination lists, and the need for more intuitive, inspirational browsing. They wished for clearer destination previews, simplified search paths, and better curated recommendations to guide their trip planning process.
